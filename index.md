Certified Proof Search for Intuitionistic Linear Logic
======================================================

This website is automatically generated using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/).
The paper and the codebase it relies on are both typecheked using [Agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/)
and the following artefacts are produced:

* The [paper](pdf/lps-short.pdf) itself as well as an [extended version](pdf/lps.pdf) which
  are both [literate Agda files](https://github.com/gallais/proof-search-ILLWiL/tree/master/papers).

* The html version of the highlighted source code.

You probably want to start with [a few examples](html/lps.Examples.html) of the solver in action.
